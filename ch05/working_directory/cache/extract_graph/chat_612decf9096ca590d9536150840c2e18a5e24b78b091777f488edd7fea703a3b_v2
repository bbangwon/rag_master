Before the era of popular agitation\nand governmental antagonism, railroad bonds enjoyed a large measure of\npublic confidence; but it can not be denied that some part of this\nconfidence has been shaken as a result of the recent exposures. Even\nclearheaded men have exaggerated the importance of the developments; and\ntoo often railroad officials, who should have insisted upon the\nsoundness and stability of their properties, when they elected to talk\nfor publication, have given way instead to dismal and unwarranted\nforebodings.\n\nThere is no mystery involved in determining the safety of railroad\nbonds. Any man of business experience, keeping in mind the general\nprinciple which measures the value of all obligations, can easily\ndetermine, with the aid of two documents, the degree of safety which\nattaches to any particular railroad bond. The general principle to be\nobserved is that the safety of any obligation depends upon the margin of\nsecurity in excess of the amount of the loan; and the two documents to\nbe consulted are the mortgage or trust indenture securing the bonds,\nwhich describes the property mortgaged, and the last annual report of\nthe railroad, which shows its financial condition.\n\nConfining the analysis, for the present\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": null, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_612decf9096ca590d9536150840c2e18a5e24b78b091777f488edd7fea703a3b_v2"}
