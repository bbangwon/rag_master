Under such money conditions the\nequipment bonds could be sold on about a 6-per-cent basis, which would\nmean a price of 99 for a 5-per-cent bond with one year to run. The firm,\nin liquidating its investment, would therefore lose 1 per cent in\nprincipal, but would have received 5 per cent interest for two years,\nmaking the net return 4-1/2 per cent. Compare this showing with the\nresult if the bonds when originally bought had had ten years to run\ninstead of three.\n\nAfter two years, when the firm wished to dispose of its bonds it might\nexperience some difficulty in doing so in the stringent money market\nwhich has been supposed, but even if it succeeded in selling them upon a\n6-per-cent basis, that would mean a price of only 93-3/4 and would\nrepresent 6-1/4-per-cent loss in principal. If it were necessary to sell\nthe bonds upon a higher basis or if the firm had purchased a bond with\nmore than ten years to run, the relative disadvantage of the longer bond\nwould be still more apparent.
