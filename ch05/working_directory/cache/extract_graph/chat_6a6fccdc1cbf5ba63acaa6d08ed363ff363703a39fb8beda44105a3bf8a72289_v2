One of these influences is the loaning\nrate of free capital; the other is the general condition of business. A\nlow rate of interest or the likelihood of low rates has the effect of\nstimulating security prices, because banks and other money-lending\ninstitutions are forced into the investment market when they can not\nloan money to advantage. Conversely, a high rate of interest or the\nprospect of high rates has the effect of depressing prices, because\nbanking institutions sell their securities in order to lend the money so\nreleased. The automatic working of this process tends to produce a\nconstant adjustment between the yields upon free and invested capital.\nWhen money rates are low, securities tend to advance to the point where\nthe return upon them is no greater than that derived from the loaning of\nfree capital. When rates are high, securities tend to decline to a point\nwhere the return is as great. This explains the influence of the first\nfactor.\n\nThe other factor is the general condition of business. Good business\nconditions, or the promise of good conditions, tend to advance security\nprices, because they indicate larger earnings and a stronger financial\ncondition. Poor business conditions, or an unpromising outlook, have the\nreverse effect.\n\nThe larger movements of security prices are always the resultant of the\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": null, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_6a6fccdc1cbf5ba63acaa6d08ed363ff363703a39fb8beda44105a3bf8a72289_v2"}
