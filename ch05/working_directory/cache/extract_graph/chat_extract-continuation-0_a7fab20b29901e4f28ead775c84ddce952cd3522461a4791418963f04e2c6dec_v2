In the case of real-estate mortgages the amount of this\nmargin may be determined without great difficulty. It is only necessary\nto have the property carefully appraised by an expert in real-estate\nvalues. It does not follow, however, because a mortgage has been shown\nto possess substantial equity, that it is perfectly safe as an\ninvestment, unless it satisfies also another condition of great\nimportance. A mortgage may not exceed 50 per cent of the selling value\nof the real estate pledged, and yet be a poor investment. This point\ninvolves a serious objection to real-estate mortgages which sometimes\nescapes notice.\n\nThe holder of a mortgage is at a great disadvantage in regard to the\nchanging value of real estate.
