A savings-bank\nrequires, also, great safety of principal and interest; _i.e._, the\ncertainty that principal and interest instalments will be paid at\nmaturity. It needs only a fair but not high yield, and it does not need\nto place emphasis upon convertibility or prospect of appreciation in\nvalue. Comparison of these requirements with the characteristics of\ninactive municipal bonds discloses a striking adaptability on their\npart to the real needs of the case. As a consequence, it is not\nsurprizing to discover that inactive municipals are greatly sought\nby savings-banks.\n\nThe desirability of inactive municipals for savings-bank investment was\nnever more forcibly illustrated than on the first of last January, when\nthe savings-banks came to make up their annual statements.
