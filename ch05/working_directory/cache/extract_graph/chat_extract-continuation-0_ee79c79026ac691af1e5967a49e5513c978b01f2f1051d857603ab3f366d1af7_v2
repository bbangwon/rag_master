This covers the\nchief period of railroad receivership. It was discovered that sixteen\ndifferent railroads, aggregating nearly one hundred thousand miles and\nlocated in widely different parts of the country, had outstanding\nequipment bonds at the time of default. In every case the principal and\ninterest of equipment bonds were paid in full, while all other\nsecurities, with a few exceptions, were reduced in rate or amount or\nboth. Two of these railroads offered to the holders of equipment bonds\nthe option of an advantageous exchange of securities, which amounted to\nmore than payment in full.\n\nThe foregoing facts justify the conclusion that equipment bonds possess\nsecurity equal or superior to that of any other form of railroad bonds.\n\nLet us now consider their remaining characteristics--their rate of\nincome, convertibility, prospect of appreciation in value, and stability\nof market price.\n\nOne of the strongest features of equipment bonds is the relatively high\nrate of income which they yield. The amount realized varies in\naccordance with the financial strength and credit of the issuing\nrailroad, and the margin of security in the equipment itself. As a\ngeneral rule, the net return on the equipment bonds of a given railroad\nis usually from 1/2 per cent to 3/4 per cent greater than on the\nfirst-mortgage bonds of the same railroad. This is owing to the fact\nthat while banks and\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>EQUIPMENT BONDS<|>EVENT<|>Equipment bonds are a type of security issued by railroads, which have shown a strong rate of income and security compared to other railroad bonds.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RAILROADS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Railroads are companies that operate trains and transport goods and passengers across various regions, often issuing bonds for financing.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>EQUIPMENT BONDS<|>RAILROADS<|>Equipment bonds are issued by railroads and are a significant financial instrument in the railroad industry<|>7)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
