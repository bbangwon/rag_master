In such a case the\nquestion would arise how far the capital and surplus of the guaranteeing\ncompanies would extend in liquidating the mortgages which they had\nguaranteed. This would depend entirely upon the proportion between the\ncapital and surplus of the companies and the total amount of outstanding\nmortgages guaranteed. Ordinarily the capital and surplus do not exceed 5\nper cent of the mortgages, so that the average guaranty is good for\nabout 5 per cent additional equity. On a piece of property worth\n$100,000, upon which a guaranteed mortgage of $60,000 exists, the\nguaranty would be worth $3,000, and would margin the property down to\n$57,000. This additional equity is of little value. It is probably\nunlikely that a 40-per-cent depreciation in value will take place, but\nthe guaranty is not needed unless it does, and if it should occur, the\ndepreciation is quite as likely to go to 50 per cent or more as to stop\nat 43.\n\nFrom the second point of\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": null, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_29fea0c65f1ac9f055bfad1e1bfcaff2490b55bb8c723c090b9156601b05d9e0_v2"}
