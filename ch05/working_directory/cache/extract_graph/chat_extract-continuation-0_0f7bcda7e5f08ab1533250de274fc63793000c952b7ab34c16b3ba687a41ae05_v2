A table on page\n60 shows that the total railroad capital of the United States for that\nyear was $14,570,421,478, of which $7,766,661,385, or 53.31 per cent,\nwas in the form of bonded debt, and the rest in capital stock.\n\nThese figures indicate a substantial equity, but are somewhat misleading\nbecause they refer to par value. A fair estimate of the market value of\nthis stock equity, which is the margin of security in the properties\nfrom the bondholder's point of view, can be obtained from a table on\npage 82, which shows a balance available for dividends, after paying all\noperating expenses and fixt charges, of all the railroads of the United\nStates for the year ended June 30, 1906, of $457,060,326. This amount is\nequivalent to nearly 7 per cent upon the total par value of the stocks.\n\nEstimating that a railroad stock should earn 10 per cent upon its market\nprice--and even the most prejudiced will admit that a stock earning 10\nper cent is worth par--the total market value of American railroad\nstocks would be $4\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>INTER-STATE COMMERCE COMMISSION<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Inter-State Commerce Commission was a regulatory agency in the United States that oversaw railroad operations and published reports on railroad securities and safety.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>UNITED STATES<|>GEO<|>The United States is a country where the total railroad capital and securities are being analyzed, particularly in the context of the year 1906.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>1906<|>EVENT<|>The year 1906 is significant for the railroad industry as it marks the time when the last published report of the Inter-State Commerce Commission was released, providing key financial data on railroad securities.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>INTER-STATE COMMERCE COMMISSION<|>UNITED STATES<|>The Inter-State Commerce Commission operated within the United States and provided regulatory oversight for the railroad industry in the country<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>INTER-STATE COMMERCE COMMISSION<|>1906<|>The report published by the Inter-State Commerce Commission in 1906 provided important data regarding railroad securities<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>UNITED STATES<|>1906<|>The year 1906 is a reference point for the financial analysis of railroad securities in the United States<|>6)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
