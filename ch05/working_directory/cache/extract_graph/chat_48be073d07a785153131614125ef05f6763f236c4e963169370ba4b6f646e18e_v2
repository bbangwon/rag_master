As a thorough understanding of this\npoint is essential to an accurate judgment of bond values, whether\nrailroad bonds or otherwise, it must be developed in detail, even at the\nrisk of carrying the reader over familiar ground.\n\nIf a bond sells above par, it does not yield its purchaser a net return\nas great as the rate of interest which the bond bears, for two reasons:\nfirst, because the loss in principal, represented by the premium which\nthe purchaser pays, must be distributed over the number of years which\nthe bond has to run, and operates to reduce the rate of interest which\nthe holder receives; and, secondly, because the rate is paid only on the\npar value of the bond instead of on the actual money invested. Thus, if\na 6-percent bond with eight years to run sells at 110-3/4, it will yield\nonly 4.40 per cent, which means that if the holder spends more than\n$48.73 (4.40 per cent of $1,107.50) out of the $60 which he receives\nannually, he is spending the excess out of principal, and not out of\nincome.
