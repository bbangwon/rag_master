For this\nreason the industrial bonds which hold out the greatest promise of\nappreciation in value are the larger, more speculative issues, which\npossess the greatest convertibility. The purchase of such bonds\nfrequently results in substantial profits.\n\nV. _Stability of Market Price._ The four points above touched\nupon--safety, rate of income, convertibility, and likelihood of\nimprovement in intrinsic value--are all inherent characteristics of\nevery bond. The likelihood of favorable or unfavorable fluctation in\nmarket price is largely external in its nature and depends upon general\nfinancial and business conditions.\n\nAs a class, industrial bonds can not be said to possess much stability\nof market price. Some of the smaller issues enjoy a fictitious stability\nbecause of their inactivity, but generally speaking industrial bonds are\nsubject to wide fluctations in accordance with changes in the business\noutlook.\n\nThe foregoing is a summary, necessarily brief and imperfect, of the main\npoints to be considered in judging the value of industrial bonds. The\nquestion remains whether such securities are desirable for the\ninvestment of a business surplus and of private funds.\n\nExcept in special cases industrial bonds are not suitable for a business\nsurplus.
