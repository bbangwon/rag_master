The fact that real-estate mortgages can not be readily\ndisposed of makes it practically impossible to employ them for the\ninvestment of a business surplus.\n\nWhere convertibility is not an essential requirement, and where the want\nof promise of appreciation in value is not a serious matter, mortgages\nafford a very desirable form of investment. The characteristics which\nthey possess in an eminent degree--safety, high return, and assurance\nagainst loss in quoted value of principal--are exactly suited to the\nordinary requirements of savings-banks. Generally speaking, only a small\nproportion of a savings-bank's assets need be kept in liquid form or\nreadily convertible, and accordingly they find mortgages highly\ndesirable.\n\nFor the purpose of private investment the attractiveness of mortgages is\nnot so easy to determine. Ordinarily, fluctations in quoted values are\nof no great importance to the private investor, so that the absence of\nquotation which mortgages enjoy is not especially valuable. Their safety\nand high return are attractive qualities, but their want of\nconvertibility and of prospect of appreciation in value are drawbacks.\nOn the whole, the private investor may probably employ with advantage a\ncertain part, but not too much of his estate in mortgage investments.\n\nAs part of a scientific and comprehensive scheme of investment, the\nspecial\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": null, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_96e4ccca189ee73529da26df85ae215624e895c5cbcf21e8e035282fdcd71955_v2"}
