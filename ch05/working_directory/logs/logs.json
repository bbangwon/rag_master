The indications most to be relied upon in estimating\nthe safety of industrial bonds are as follows:\n\n(_a_) _Value of real estate._ The first point to be determined in\nconsidering the purchase of an industrial bond is the value of the real\nestate upon which it is a first mortgage. If the appraised value of the\nground, irrespective of the buildings and machinery upon it, is greater\nby a substantial sum than the amount of the bond issue, the obligation\nis practically a real-estate mortgage. In such a case, while possibly\n\"slow,\" _i.e._, secured by an assets difficult to realize upon--the\nsafety of the bond can hardly be questioned. In judging a bond upon its\nreal-estate value, it is not always safe to take the cost price of the\nland as shown by the company's books, because frequently the cost upon\nthe books is artificially raised by payment having been made in\nsecurities whose market value is less than par, or in other ways. As\nstated above, judgment should be based upon the _appraised_ value of the\nland.\n\nIf the bond meets this test satisfactorily, the prospective investor may\nfeel reasonably sure that the safety of his principal is not in\nquestion, and may buy the bond without anxiety\n######################\nOutput:",

In judging a bond upon its\nreal-estate value, it is not always safe to take the cost price of the\nland as shown by the company's books, because frequently the cost upon\nthe books is artificially raised by payment having been made in\nsecurities whose market value is less than par, or in other ways.

No consideration is of greater importance in the\ninvestment of a business surplus than a high degree of convertibility,\nso that if the need should arise the investment may be instantly\nliquidated. The fact that real-estate mortgages can not be readily\ndisposed of makes it practically impossible to employ them for the\ninvestment of a business surplus.\n\nWhere convertibility is not an essential requirement, and where the want\nof promise of appreciation in value is not a serious matter, mortgages\nafford a very desirable form of investment.

The\nbonded debt should never exceed net quick assets, except when the\ncompany possesses real estate, in which case two-thirds of the\nreal-estate value plus the net quick assets should cover the bonds. Some\ncompanies do much better than that.

If the capital liabilities exactly balance\nthe property assets, it is plain that the surplus will exactly balance\nthe net quick assets. If the surplus is smaller than net quick assets,\nit is usually a sign that capital liabilities have been created to\nprovide working capital. Opinions differ as to the wisdom of this\ncourse. Generally speaking, it is better to provide working capital by\nmeans of a stock issue than to depend upon the banks for accommodation.\nThe exception to this rule occurs in the case of companies that require\na great deal of working capital for part of the year and only a little\nat other times.

Generally speaking, it is better to provide working capital by\nmeans of a stock issue than to depend upon the banks for accommodation.\nThe exception to this rule occurs in the case of companies that require\na great deal of working capital for part of the year and only a little\nat other times.

The question is\ndifficult to answer. Industrial bonds vary greatly in point of safety,\nsome issues possessing great strength and others being highly\nspeculative. No general conclusions can be depended upon, and the\ninvestor is forced to consider each issue upon its own merits.\n\nII. _Rate of Income._ The average net return upon industrial bonds is\nprobably higher than upon any other form of funded corporate obligation.\nThis constitutes one of the chief advantages of industrial bonds.\n\nIII. _Convertibility._ It is impossible to make any general statement in\nregard to the convertibility of industrial bonds. Some industrial\nbonds, notably the larger issues of well-known trusts, command a broad\nand active market. Such bonds can be sold in large amounts at almost any\ntime without seriously affecting the price. On the other hand, small\nunderlying issues of such companies, usually high-grade in point of\nsecurity, or the obligations of smaller companies, are almost as\nunmarketable as real-estate mortgages. Between these two extremes all\nvarieties of industrial bonds are to be found.

The question is\ndifficult to answer. Industrial bonds vary greatly in point of safety,\nsome issues possessing great strength and others being highly\nspeculative. No general conclusions can be depended upon, and the\ninvestor is forced to consider each issue upon its own merits.\n\nII. _Rate of Income._ The average net return upon industrial bonds is\nprobably higher than upon any other form of funded corporate obligation.\nThis constitutes one of the chief advantages of industrial bonds.\n\nIII. _Convertibility._ It is impossible to make any general statement in\nregard to the convertibility of industrial bonds. Some industrial\nbonds, notably the larger issues of well-known trusts, command a broad\nand active market. Such bonds can be sold in large amounts at almost any\ntime without seriously affecting the price. On the other hand, small\nunderlying issues of such companies, usually high-grade in point of\nsecurity, or the obligations of smaller companies, are almost as\nunmarketable as real-estate mortgages. Between these two extremes all\nvarieties of industrial bonds are to be found. The degree of\nconvertibility which a security possesses is usually a matter of some\nimportance, and"

If the principal of the bond does not\nbecome due for a number of years, there is danger that the property will\ndepreciate so far in value as to leave the bond without sufficient\nmargin of protection. There are two ways to overcome this difficulty.\nOne way is to establish a sinking-fund which will retire a certain\nproportion of the bonds by lot each year. Another way is to issue the\nbonds in serial form, with a definite instalment maturing every year.

If the result of the examination shows that the property could\nnot be duplicated for the amount of the bond issue, the company occupies\nan unusually strong position--altho even in such a case some part of the\nvalue of the bonds comes from the strength of the company as a going\nconcern.\n\nIn most cases\n######################\nOutput:",

It is probable that the obligations\nof the United States Government, by reason of the fact that the\nper-capita debt of the country is so small, the wealth of the country so\ngreat, and the good faith of the American people so clearly established,\nrepresent the highest type of security to be found in the world. It is\nquite possible, therefore, that the 2-per-cent United States Consols\nwould sell in any case at a relatively higher price than the obligations\nof any other country, but it can not be denied that the chief reason\nwhich causes them to sell at the remarkably high price which they have\nattained is the fact that they are required by national banks as\nsecurity for circulation. This fact is doubtless the controlling element\nin their market position, and at once accounts for their special\nstrength and removes them from the field of private investment.\n\nOnly less secure than United States bonds are the obligations of the\nsovereign States of the Union. State bonds usually sell upon a basis\nwhich may be taken as the equivalent of pure interest, with no element\nof risk or speculation involved.

It is\nquite possible, therefore, that the 2-per-cent United States Consols\nwould sell in any case at a relatively higher price than the obligations\nof any other country, but it can not be denied that the chief reason\nwhich causes them to sell at the remarkably high price which they have\nattained is the fact that they are required by national banks as\nsecurity for circulation. This fact is doubtless the controlling element\nin their market position, and at once accounts for their special\nstrength and removes them from the field of private investment.\n\nOnly less secure than United States bonds are the obligations of the\nsovereign States of the Union.

It was\nimperative that they should obtain more capital, and it was impossible\nto dispose of sufficient stock on the basis of a speculative risk in a\nbusiness venture. It was therefore necessary for the railway-managers to\nemphasize, as far as possible, the investment character of their stock,\nand various expedients were adopted to accomplish this purpose. In some\ncases preferred stocks were created or resulted from reorganizations,\nwhich possest a first lien upon the assets after payment of the\nobligations, and which were entitled to a certain stipulated dividend\nbefore the common stock obtained any distribution from the earnings.

It was impossible to provide this\ncapital wholly by means of bond issues without destroying the proportion\nbetween bonds and stocks, which alone could give to the bondholders the\nprotection of a substantial equity. It was therefore necessary to obtain\na large part of the capital required in the form of stock. The\nrailway-managers were thus confronted with a difficult problem. It was\nimperative that they should obtain more capital, and it was impossible\nto dispose of sufficient stock on the basis of a speculative risk in a\nbusiness venture. It was therefore necessary for the railway-managers to\nemphasize, as far as possible, the investment character of their stock,\nand various expedients were adopted to accomplish this purpose. In some\ncases preferred stocks were created or resulted from reorganizations,\nwhich possest a first lien upon the assets after payment of the\nobligations, and which were entitled to a certain stipulated dividend\nbefore the common stock obtained any distribution from the earnings. In\nthis way the railway-managers created a compromise security which could\nbe regarded as a stock, and would thus provide equity from the\nbondholders' point of view, and, at the same time, one which could be\ndisposed of to investors.

This explains the influence of the first\nfactor.\n\nThe other factor is the general condition of business. Good business\nconditions, or the promise of good conditions, tend to advance security\nprices, because they indicate larger earnings and a stronger financial\ncondition. Poor business conditions, or an unpromising outlook, have the\nreverse effect.\n\nThe larger movements of security prices are always the resultant of the\ninteraction of these two forces. When they work together the effect is\nirresistible, as when low interest rates and the prospect of good\nbusiness conditions occur together, or when high money rates occur in\nthe face of an indicated falling off in business activity. At such times\nall classes of securities swing together. For the most part, however,\nmoney rates and business conditions are opposed in their influence,\nrates being low when business is bad and high when business is good.\nUsually the worse business conditions become, the easier money grows;\nwhile the more active business becomes, the higher money rates rise. The\neffect of this antagonism between the controlling causes is to produce\nmovements of different proportions and sometimes in different directions\nin different classes of securities. High-grade bonds may be declining,\nmiddle-grade bonds remaining stationary, and poor bonds advancing, all\nat the same time. This serves to give a very irregular appearance to the\nsecurity markets, and appears to justify the widely held\n######################\nOutput:",

This explains the influence of the first\nfactor.\n\nThe other factor is the general condition of business. Good business\nconditions, or the promise of good conditions, tend to advance security\nprices, because they indicate larger earnings and a stronger financial\ncondition. Poor business conditions, or an unpromising outlook, have the\nreverse effect.\n\nThe larger movements of security prices are always the resultant of the\ninteraction of these two forces. When they work together the effect is\nirresistible, as when low interest rates and the prospect of good\nbusiness conditions occur together, or when high money rates occur in\nthe face of an indicated falling off in business activity. At such times\nall classes of securities swing together. For the most part, however,\nmoney rates and business conditions are opposed in their influence,\nrates being low when business is bad and high when business is good.\nUsually the worse business conditions become, the easier money grows;\nwhile the more active business becomes, the higher money rates rise. The\neffect of this antagonism between the controlling causes is to produce\nmovements of different proportions and sometimes in different directions\nin different classes of securities. High-grade bonds may be declining,\nmiddle-grade bonds remaining stationary, and poor bonds advancing, all\nat the same time. This serves to give a very irregular appearance to the\nsecurity markets, and appears to justify the widely held"

The only form of\nmunicipal security which is at all adapted for the investment of a\nbusiness surplus is a short-term issue of an active municipal bond.

Enough has been\nsaid in the preceding chapters to impress upon the reader the importance\nof buying securities only in accordance with his real requirements. If\nany investor, after careful comparison of the characteristics of\nmunicipal bonds, either active or inactive, with his necessities,\ndecides that he can more closely satisfy his requirements with\nmunicipals than with any other form of security, he should not hesitate\nto purchase them.

In the\none case he buys a promise to pay and in the other an equity.\n\nThis distinction, which appears plainly marked in theory, has been\nmuch obscured in recent years by the influence of two factors. As the\ncountry grew in size, the large corporations--the railroads, for\nexample--required greater capital in order to provide facilities for the\nhandling of their growing business. It was impossible to provide this\ncapital wholly by means of bond issues without destroying the proportion\nbetween bonds and stocks, which alone could give to the bondholders the\nprotection of a substantial equity.
