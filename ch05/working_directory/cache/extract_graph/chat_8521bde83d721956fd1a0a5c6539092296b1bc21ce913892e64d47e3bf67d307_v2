Of course, when a railroad earns more than twice the\ninterest requirement upon its entire bonded debt, it is probable that\nsome of the underlying bonds are protected by three, four, or five times\nthe interest requirement upon them, and their position is\ncorrespondingly strengthened.\n\nThe foregoing analysis applies particularly to mortgage bonds upon the\ngeneral mileage of a railroad and not to such special issues as\ncollateral trust, terminal, bridge, or guaranteed bonds. It will not be\nnecessary, however, to lay down any rules as to these classes of bonds,\nfor the general principles outlined above, with slight modifications of\ndetail, will be found equally applicable to a judgment of their value.\nEquipment bonds, on the other hand, owing to their want of similarity to\nany other railroad issues, will receive separate treatment later.\n\nIt is of interest, in view of the present diminished confidence in\nrailroad securities, to advance certain considerations touching upon the\nsafety of railroad bonds in general.\n\nThe last published report of the Inter-State Commerce Commission, year\n1906, furnishes interesting testimony on this subject. A table on page\n60 shows that the total railroad capital of the United States for that\nyear was $14,570,421,478, of which $7,766,661,385, or 53.31 per cent,\nwas\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": null, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_8521bde83d721956fd1a0a5c6539092296b1bc21ce913892e64d47e3bf67d307_v2"}
