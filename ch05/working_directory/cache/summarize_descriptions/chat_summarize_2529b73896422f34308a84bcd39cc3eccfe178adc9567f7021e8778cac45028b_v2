In this arrangement, the property being acquired serves as collateral for the loan, ensuring that the lender has a claim to the property should the borrower default on their payments. Mortgages typically require the borrower to make regular interest payments, along with the principal amount, and are structured to be redeemed at maturity, which is the end of the loan term.\n\nThis type of loan is specifically designed for real estate transactions, making it a crucial component of the home-buying process. By securing the loan against the property, lenders mitigate their risk, while borrowers gain access to the necessary funds to acquire a home or other real estate.
