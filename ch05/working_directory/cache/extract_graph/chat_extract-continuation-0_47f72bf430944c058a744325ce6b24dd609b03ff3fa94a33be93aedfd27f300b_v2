Bonds, real-estate mortgages, and loans on collateral\nrepresent somebody's promise to pay a certain sum of money at a future\ndate; and if the promise be good and the security ample, the holder of\nthe promise will be paid the money at the time due. On the other hand,\n_equities_, such as the capital stocks of banking, railway, and\nindustrial corporations, represent only a certain residuary share in the\nassets and profits of a working concern, after payment of its\nobligations and fixt charges. The value of this residuary share may be\nlarge or small, may increase or diminish, but in no case can the holder\nof such a share require any one, least of all the company itself, to\nredeem the certificate representing his interest at the price he paid\nfor it, nor indeed at any price. If a man buys a $1,000 railroad bond,\nhe knows that the railroad, if solvent, will pay him $1,000 in cash when\nthe bond is due. But if he buys a share of railroad stock, his only\nchance of getting his money back, if he should wish it, is that some\none else will want to buy his share for what he paid for it, or more.
