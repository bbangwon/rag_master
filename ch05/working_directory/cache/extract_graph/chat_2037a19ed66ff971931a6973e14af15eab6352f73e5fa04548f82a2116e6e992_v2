The\neffect of this antagonism between the controlling causes is to produce\nmovements of different proportions and sometimes in different directions\nin different classes of securities. High-grade bonds may be declining,\nmiddle-grade bonds remaining stationary, and poor bonds advancing, all\nat the same time. This serves to give a very irregular appearance to the\nsecurity markets, and appears to justify the widely held opinion that\nsecurity prices are a pure matter of guesswork, and that they are\ncontrolled only by manipulation and special influences. A clear\nconception of the nature of the influences which are always silently at\nwork reconciles these apparent inconsistencies and makes it plain that\ngeneral price movements are determined by laws as certain in their\noperation as the laws of nature.\n\nThis may be illustrated by a single example. Let us assume that interest\nrates are low and business conditions bad with prospect of still lower\ninterest rates and still more unpromising business conditions. What will\nbe the effect upon different classes of securities? High-grade bonds,\nsuch as choice municipals, whose safety can not be impaired by any\nextent of depression in business, will advance because their market\nprice is influenced almost wholly by money rates. If their interest is\ncertain to be paid, no matter what business conditions may become, they\ncan not be greatly affected by a reduction of earnings, and consequently\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": null, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_2037a19ed66ff971931a6973e14af15eab6352f73e5fa04548f82a2116e6e992_v2"}
