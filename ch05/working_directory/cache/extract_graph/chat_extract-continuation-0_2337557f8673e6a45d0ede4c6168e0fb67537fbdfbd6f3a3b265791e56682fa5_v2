The knowledge that they possess this power renders\nits exercise generally unnecessary. The equipment of a railroad is\nessential to its operation. It is the tool with which the railroad\nhandles its business. If the receiver were deprived of the equipment it\nwould be impossible for him to operate the road, and so he could never\nsatisfy its creditors. Consequently the courts, both State and Federal,\nhave ruled that the necessary equipment of a bankrupt railroad must be\npreserved, and have placed the charges for principal and interest of\nequipment obligations upon an equality with charges for wages,\nmaterials, and other operating expenses, and in priority to interest of\neven first-mortgage bonds.\n\nThese points sufficiently explain the remarkable record which equipment\nbonds have made during reorganizations. Careful investigation has been\nmade of the various railroads which were reorganized, either with or\nwithout foreclosure, between the years 1888 and 1905. This covers the\nchief period of railroad receivership. It was discovered that sixteen\ndifferent railroads, aggregating nearly one hundred thousand miles and\nlocated in widely different parts of the country, had outstanding\nequipment bonds at the time of default. In every case the principal and\ninterest of equipment bonds were paid in full, while all other\nsecurities, with a few exceptions, were reduced in rate or amount or\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>RAILROAD<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A railroad is a company that operates trains and manages the transportation of goods and passengers across tracks, relying on essential equipment for its operations.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>EQUIPMENT BONDS<|>EVENT<|>Equipment bonds are financial instruments issued by railroads to secure funding for necessary equipment, which are prioritized in bankruptcy reorganizations.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BANKRUPT RAILROAD<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A railroad that has declared bankruptcy and is undergoing reorganization to satisfy its creditors while preserving essential equipment.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>EQUIPMENT BONDS<|>BANKRUPT RAILROAD<|>Equipment bonds are crucial for bankrupt railroads to maintain operations and satisfy creditors during reorganizations<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>RAILROAD<|>BANKRUPT RAILROAD<|>A bankrupt railroad is a type of railroad that has failed financially and is undergoing reorganization<|>7)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
