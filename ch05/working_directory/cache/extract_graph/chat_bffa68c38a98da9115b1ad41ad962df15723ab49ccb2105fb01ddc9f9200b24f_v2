This is a very important figure. As with gross\nearnings, the reports should be examined to determine whether net income\nis on the increase or the decrease, and it should be compared with the\nnet income of other railroads occupying the same field. It involves a\ncriticism of operating expenses. The payments of the railroad must be\nanalyzed to determine whether the proper sums have been expended for\nmaintenance of way, replenishment of rolling stock, and other\nimprovements sufficient to keep the road in good physical condition.\nNormally speaking, operating expenses should absorb about 65 per cent of\ngross earnings. If it is found that a railroad operates for 60 per cent,\nhowever, it does not always follow that its operating officials are\nexceptionally efficient, so that the cost of conducting transportation\nis relatively small; it may mean that the physical condition of the\nproperty is being neglected, or that ordinary improvements, which should\nbe charged to maintenance, are being paid for by increase in\ncapitalization.
