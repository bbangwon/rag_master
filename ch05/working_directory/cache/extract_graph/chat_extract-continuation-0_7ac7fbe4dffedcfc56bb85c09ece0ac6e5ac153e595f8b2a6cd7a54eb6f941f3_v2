The number of men who carry out this principle with\nany thoroughness, however, is very small. Proper distribution means not\nonly the division of property among the various forms of investment, as\nrailroad bonds, municipals, mortgages, public-utility bonds, etc., but\nalso the preservation of proper geographical proportions within each\nform. Adherence to this principle is perhaps not so important for\nprivate investors as for institutions. A striking instance of the need\nfor insistence upon its observance in the institutional field was\nfurnished by one of the fire-insurance companies of San Francisco after\nthe earthquake. It appeared that the company's assets were largely\ninvested in San Francisco real estate and in local enterprises\ngenerally, where the bulk of its fire risks were concentrated. As a\nresult, the very catastrophe which converted its risks into actual\nliabilities deprived its assets of all immediate value. This instance\nserves to show the importance of the principle and the necessity for its\nobservance.\n\nThe principle of selection in accordance with real requirements is more\ncomplex. It involves a thorough understanding of the chief points which\nmust be considered in the selection of all investments. These are five\nin number: (1) _Safety of principal and interest_, or the assurance of\nreceiving the principal and interest on the dates due; (2) _\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>SAN FRANCISCO<|>GEO<|>San Francisco is a city in California that experienced a significant earthquake, impacting local fire-insurance companies and their investments.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FIRE-INSURANCE COMPANY<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A type of organization that provides coverage against fire risks, which was significantly affected by the earthquake in San Francisco.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FIRE-INSURANCE COMPANY<|>SAN FRANCISCO<|>The fire-insurance company had its assets heavily invested in San Francisco, leading to significant losses after the earthquake<|>8)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
