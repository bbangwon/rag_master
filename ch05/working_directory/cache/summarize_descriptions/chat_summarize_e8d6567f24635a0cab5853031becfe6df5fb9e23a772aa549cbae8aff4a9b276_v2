Additionally, they can signify a creditor relationship with a governmental body or corporation through bonds, where investors lend money in exchange for periodic interest payments and the return of the bond's face value at maturity.\n\nFurthermore, securities also include options, which provide rights to ownership without the obligation to purchase the underlying asset.
