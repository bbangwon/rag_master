In the state of\nbusiness feeling which has been pictured, the undertaking of new\nbusiness ventures or additions to existing properties would not be\napproved, so that the surplus wealth created finds its way into bank\ndeposits as liquid capital. The competitive attempt to loan this capital\nat a time when borrowers are few produces merely nominal interest rates.\nThis continues for some time. It is only gradually as confidence returns\nand as the spirit of initiative begins to reassert itself that some part\nof the liquid capital created each year is diverted into fixt forms.\nHere and there some enterprising group of men will develop a mine, lay a\nnew piece of railway, or make some addition to an existing undertaking.\nFor some length of time, however, the liquid capital of the country not\nonly remains unimpaired, but is continually increasing.
