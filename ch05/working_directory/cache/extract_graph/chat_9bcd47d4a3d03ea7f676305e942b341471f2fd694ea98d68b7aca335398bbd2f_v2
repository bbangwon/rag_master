A mortgage may not exceed 50 per cent of the selling value\nof the real estate pledged, and yet be a poor investment. This point\ninvolves a serious objection to real-estate mortgages which sometimes\nescapes notice.\n\nThe holder of a mortgage is at a great disadvantage in regard to the\nchanging value of real estate. If the value of the property upon which\nhe holds a mortgage increases, the additional value enhances the\nsecurity of the loan, but does not add to the principal which he has\ninvested, while if the value of the property diminishes, not only is the\nsecurity proportionately lessened, but if the impairment be great, the\nholder is frequently compelled to take over the property and may suffer\nloss of principal. In other words, he receives no direct benefit from an\nincrease in the value of the property, but has to stand the larger part\nof the risk of a decline in its value.\n\nThis is not the case with investments represented by negotiable\nsecurities subject to changing market quotations. All such securities,\nrailroad bonds for example, are acted on equally by changes in the value\nof the property which secures them. Except for the influences of\nmoney-market conditions, railroad bonds advance with an increase in the\nvalue of the property and decline with a decrease in its value.\nWell-selected bonds usually increase in value with time, and all\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": null, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_9bcd47d4a3d03ea7f676305e942b341471f2fd694ea98d68b7aca335398bbd2f_v2"}
