A large part of the problem of investment lies\nin the careful selection of securities to meet one's actual\nrequirements. The average investor does not thoroughly understand this\npoint. He does not realize that a high degree of one quality involves a\nlower degree of other qualities. He may have a general impression that a\nhigh rate of income is apt to indicate less assurance of safety, but he\nrarely applies the same reasoning to other qualities. When he buys\nsecurities, he is quite likely to pay for qualities which he does not\nneed. It is very common, for example, when he wishes to make a permanent\ninvestment and has no thought of reselling, to find him purchasing\nsecurities which possess in a high degree the quality of convertibility.\nFrom his point of view, this is pure waste. A high degree of\nconvertibility is only obtained at the sacrifice of some other\nquality--usually rate of income. If he were to use more care in his\nselections, he could probably find some other security possessing equal\nsafety, equal stability, and equal promise of appreciation in value,\nwhich would yield considerably greater revenue, lacking only ready\nconvertibility. Thus he would satisfy his real requirements and obtain a\ngreater income, at the expense\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>INVESTOR<|>PERSON<|>An investor is an individual who allocates capital with the expectation of a financial return, often selecting securities based on various qualities such as income, safety, and convertibility.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SECURITIES<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Securities are financial instruments that represent an ownership position in a company (stocks), a creditor relationship with a governmental body or corporation (bonds), or rights to ownership as represented by an option.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CONVERTIBILITY<|>EVENT<|>Convertibility refers to the quality of a security that allows it to be converted into cash or another form of investment, often at the expense of other qualities like income rate.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>INVESTOR<|>SECURITIES<|>Investors select securities based on their qualities to meet their investment requirements<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>INVESTOR<|>CONVERTIBILITY<|>Investors often consider the convertibility of securities when making investment decisions, which can affect their overall strategy<|>5)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
