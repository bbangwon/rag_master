It is very important for the investor to find out which\nis the case. If analysis leads to the suspicion that the earnings result\nfrom neglecting the property or capitalizing every trivial improvement,\nthe railroad's bonds should be rejected.

The importance of this figure lies in\nits relation to net income. If a railroad does not earn well over double\nits fixt charges, its obligations can not be regarded as in the first\ninvestment rank. Of course, when a railroad earns more than twice the\ninterest requirement upon its entire bonded debt, it is probable that\nsome of the underlying bonds are protected by three, four, or five times\nthe interest requirement upon them, and their position is\ncorrespondingly strengthened.\n\nThe foregoing analysis applies particularly to mortgage bonds upon the\ngeneral mileage of a railroad and not\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>RAILROAD<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A railroad is a transportation organization that operates trains on tracks, managing the movement of goods and passengers, and is subject to financial analysis regarding its income and expenses.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BONDS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Bonds are financial instruments issued by railroads to raise capital, representing a loan made by an investor to the issuer.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>INVESTOR<|>PERSON<|>An investor is an individual or entity that allocates capital with the expectation of a financial return, often analyzing the performance of organizations like railroads.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>INVESTOR<|>RAILROAD<|>Investors analyze railroads to determine their financial health and investment potential based on income and expenses<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BONDS<|>RAILROAD<|>Bonds are issued by railroads to finance their operations and are a key aspect of their financial structure<|>8)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
