If he buys a bond he\nbecomes a creditor of the company, without voice in its management, but\nentitled to receive his principal and interest when due under pain of\nforfeiture of the security which the company made over to the trustee to\ninsure payment. If he buys stock, he becomes a partner in a business\nenterprise, exercising his proportionate share in the direction of the\ncompany's affairs, and sharing ratably in its profits and losses. In the\none case he buys a promise to pay and in the other an equity.\n\nThis distinction, which appears plainly marked in theory, has been\nmuch obscured in recent years by the influence of two factors. As the\ncountry grew in size, the large corporations--the railroads, for\nexample--required greater capital in order to provide facilities for the\nhandling of their growing business. It was impossible to provide this\ncapital wholly by means of bond issues without destroying the proportion\nbetween bonds and stocks, which alone could give to the bondholders the\nprotection of a substantial equity. It was therefore necessary to obtain\na large part of the capital required in the form of stock.
