With some investments the principal is\nmuch safer than the interest, and _vice versa_. This can best be\nillustrated by examples. The bonds of terminal companies, which are\nguaranteed as to interest, under the terms of a lease, by the railroads\nwhich use the terminal, are usually far safer as to interest than as to\nprincipal. While the lease lasts, the interest is probably perfectly\nsecure, but when the lease expires and the bonds mature, the railroads\nmay see fit to abandon the terminal and build one elsewhere, if the city\nhas grown in another direction, and the terminal may cease to have any\nvalue except as real estate. On the other hand, a new railroad, built in\na thinly settled but rapidly growing part of the country, may have\ndifficulty in bad years in meeting its interest charges, and may even go\ninto temporary default, but if the bonds are issued at a low rate per\nmile and the management of the road is honest and capable, the safety of\nthe principal can scarcely be questioned.\n\nStability of market price is frequently a consideration of great\nimportance. This quality should never be confused with the quality of\nsafety\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": null, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_e07254268bc1b99c8db97c951c9a5b1542d5380ba853927e077ae407692fdcbf_v2"}
