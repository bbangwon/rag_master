These bonds represent a loan made by an investor to a railroad company, and they are secured by the property and assets of the company. This security feature contributes to their reputation as a relatively safe investment compared to other options available in the market.\n\nThe income returns on railroad bonds typically range from 3-3/4 percent to 9 percent, making them an attractive choice for investors seeking stable yields. As negotiable securities, railroad bonds can be bought and sold in the market, providing liquidity to investors. Overall, railroad bonds are a vital tool for railroads to raise capital while offering investors a reliable source of income.\",22\r\n121,PUBLIC CONFIDENCE,\"Public confidence is the trust that investors have in financial instruments, which can be influenced by market conditions and governmental actions.\",3\r\n139,JUNIOR LIEN BONDS,\"Junior lien bonds are a specific category of bonds that hold a subordinate position in the hierarchy of claims on a company's assets during liquidation events. This means that in the event of a company's bankruptcy or liquidation, holders of junior lien bonds will only receive payment after all senior lien bondholders have been satisfied. \n\nIn the context of railroads, junior lien bonds are particularly relevant as they provide a claim on the assets of the railroad, but only after prior lien bonds have been addressed. This structure can enhance the security of the investment to some extent, as it allows junior lien bondholders to benefit from the underlying assets of the railroad, albeit in a secondary position. \n\nOverall, junior lien bonds represent a higher risk compared to senior lien bonds due to their lower priority in asset claims, but they may also offer higher potential returns to compensate for this increased risk.\",2\r\n125,ANNUAL REPORT,\"The \"\"ANNUAL REPORT\"\" is a comprehensive document that outlines a company's activities and performance over the preceding year, providing a detailed account of its financial condition. This report serves as a critical tool for stakeholders, including investors, analysts, and regulators, to evaluate the company's operational effectiveness and financial health.\n\nIn the context of a railroad, the annual report is particularly significant as it not only details the company's financial status but also offers insights that are essential for assessing the safety and reliability of its bonds. This aspect is crucial for investors who are considering the risk associated with investing in the railroad's debt instruments. The financial data presented in the annual report helps stakeholders make informed decisions regarding their investments and the overall stability of the railroad.\n\nOverall, the annual report plays a vital role in transparency and accountability, allowing various stakeholders to understand the company's performance and future prospects.\",2\r\n123,RAILROAD OFFICIALS,\"Railroad officials are individuals responsible for the management and operation of railroads, who have sometimes contributed to public uncertainty by discussing the safety of bonds.\",1\r\n124,MORTGAGE OR TRUST INDENTURE,The mortgage or trust indenture is a legal document that secures railroad bonds by describing the property mortgaged.,1\r\n126,GENERAL PRINCIPLE,\"The general principle is a foundational concept that measures the value of all obligations, including railroad bonds, based on their margin of security.\",1\r\n157,BONDHOLDER,\"A bondholder is an individual or entity that owns bonds issued by railroads, and their perspective is crucial in evaluating the margin of security in railroad properties.\",1\r\n168,GOVERNMENT BONDS,,1\r\n159,RAILROAD SECURITIES,,4\r\n167,MINING STOCKS,\"Mining stocks are a specific category of investment that pertains to shares in companies involved in the extraction of minerals. These stocks are often compared to other types of investments, such as railroad stocks. While one description suggests that mining stocks yield more than railroad stocks, another indicates that they yield less. To resolve this contradiction, it can be concluded that the yield of mining stocks can vary depending on market conditions and specific company performance, making it essential for investors to conduct thorough research before investing.\n\nOverall, mining stocks represent an opportunity for investors to engage with the mining industry, which encompasses a range of activities related to the extraction of valuable minerals and resources. These investments can be influenced by various factors, including commodity prices, regulatory changes, and global economic conditions. As such, mining stocks can be a dynamic and potentially lucrative investment option, albeit with inherent risks associated with the volatility of the mining sector.\",2\r\n171,BANK STOCKS,\"Bank stocks represent shares in banking institutions, typically yielding less than railroad stocks.\",1\r\n172,PUBLIC-UTILITY STOCKS,\"Public-utility stocks are shares in companies that provide essential services, generally yielding less than railroad stocks.\",1\r\n173,INDUSTRIAL STOCKS,\"Industrial stocks are shares in companies involved in manufacturing and production, compared to railroad stocks in terms of convertibility.\",1\r\n120,GOVERNMENTAL ANTAGONISM,\"Governmental antagonism refers to the opposition or negative sentiment expressed by government entities towards specific financial instruments, particularly railroad bonds. This antagonism has significant implications for public confidence in these financial instruments. The negative stance taken by government entities can lead to a decline in trust and investment in railroad bonds, ultimately affecting their market performance and the broader financial landscape. As a result, governmental antagonism plays a crucial role in shaping public perception and the viability of certain financial products.\",2\r\n158,CAPITAL STOCK,\"Capital stock refers to the equity ownership in a railroad company, which is part of the total railroad capital being analyzed.\",1\r\n122,BUSINESS MAN,,1\r\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\r\n231,RAILROAD STOCKS,RAILROAD BONDS,Railroad bonds yield less than railroad stocks but are known for their convertibility,27\r\n148,RAILROAD BONDS,PUBLIC CONFIDENCE,\"Public confidence in railroad bonds has been significantly shaken due to recent exposures and governmental antagonism. This decline in trust stems from various factors that have come to light, revealing issues surrounding the stability and reliability of these financial instruments. The negative sentiment is compounded by the actions and attitudes of government entities, which have contributed to a growing skepticism among investors and the general public regarding the safety and viability of investing in railroad bonds.
