It is obviously\na waste of income to have the surplus in bank-accounts; more than that,\nthere would be a constant temptation to use it and to confuse it with\nworking capital. Its best disposition is plainly in some safe\ninterest-bearing security, which can be readily sold, so that it will be\navailable for use if necessity demands.\n\nConfronted with the double problem thus outlined, what measure of\nsuccess has attended the average business man in its solution?\n\nIt is safe to say that the average man has found it easier to make money\nthan to take care of it. Money-making, for him, is the result of\nsuccessful activity in his own line of business, with which he is\nthoroughly familiar; while the investment of money is a thing apart from\nhis business, with which he is not familiar, and of which he may have\nhad little practical experience.
