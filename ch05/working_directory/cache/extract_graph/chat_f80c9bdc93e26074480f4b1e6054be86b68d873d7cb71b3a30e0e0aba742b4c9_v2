It can not be said\nthat they do. Municipal bonds possess either convertibility without\nstability of price or stability of price without convertibility. Both\nqualities are necessary for a business surplus. The only form of\nmunicipal security which is at all adapted for the investment of a\nbusiness surplus is a short-term issue of an active municipal bond. If\nit has only a very few years to run, its constant approach to maturity\nwill invest it with the necessary stability of price. But even in this\ncase equal safety and equal stability of price combined with a higher\nyield can probably be found in some high-grade railroad issue--either a\nshort-term mortgage or equipment bond.\n\nFor private investment the case is somewhat different. Enough has been\nsaid in the preceding chapters to impress upon the reader the importance\nof buying securities only in accordance with his real requirements. If\nany investor, after careful comparison of the characteristics of\nmunicipal bonds, either active or inactive, with his necessities,\ndecides that he can more closely satisfy his requirements with\nmunicipals than with any other form of security, he should not hesitate\nto purchase them. It is the opinion of the writer, however, that a\nthorough survey of the field of investment will generally disclose to\nthe investor some security in either the railroad or corporation field\nwhich will suit his requirements as well as the municipal bond and at\nthe same time\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": null, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_f80c9bdc93e26074480f4b1e6054be86b68d873d7cb71b3a30e0e0aba742b4c9_v2"}
