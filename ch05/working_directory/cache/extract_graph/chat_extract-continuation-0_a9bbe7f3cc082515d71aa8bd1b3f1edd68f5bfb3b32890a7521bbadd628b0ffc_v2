Money-making, for him, is the result of\nsuccessful activity in his own line of business, with which he is\nthoroughly familiar; while the investment of money is a thing apart from\nhis business, with which he is not familiar, and of which he may have\nhad little practical experience. His failure to invest money wisely is\nnot due to any want of intelligence or of proper care and foresight on\nhis part, as he sometimes seems to believe, but simply because he is\nignorant of the principles of a business which differs radically from\nhis own.\n\nThe investment of money is a banker's business. When the average man has\nfunds to invest, whether he be a business man or a pure investor, he\nshould consult some experienced and reliable investment banker just as\nhe would consult a doctor or a lawyer if he were in need of medical or\nlegal advice. This book is not intended to take the place of\nconsultation with a banker, but to supplement it.\n\nThe advantage of such consultation is shown by the fact that if a man\nattempts to rely on his own judgment, he is almost certain not to do the\nbest thing, even if his business instinct leads him to avoid those\nenterprises which are more plainly unpromising or fraudulent.
