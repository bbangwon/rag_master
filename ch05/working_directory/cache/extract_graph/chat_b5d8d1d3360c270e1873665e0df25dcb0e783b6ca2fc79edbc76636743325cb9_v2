This additional equity is of little value. It is probably\nunlikely that a 40-per-cent depreciation in value will take place, but\nthe guaranty is not needed unless it does, and if it should occur, the\ndepreciation is quite as likely to go to 50 per cent or more as to stop\nat 43.\n\nFrom the second point of view the value of the guaranty is much greater.\nThe distribution of risk, as in the case of fire-insurance, protects\nthe holder against loss in the event of a fall in the particular piece\nof property upon which he holds a mortgage, or even in a particular\nlocality. It can not be said, however, that the records are yet\nsufficiently complete to form a conclusion as to what is a safe\nproportion between capital and surplus and outstanding mortgages.\nFurther than that the guaranteeing companies, generally speaking, have\nbeen operating since their inception upon a rising market, so that their\nsuccess hitherto has not been remarkable. Allowing for these drawbacks,\nhowever, the private investor, unless so situated as to give personal\nattention to the details of his investments, will probably do well to\npurchase his mortgages in guaranteed form.\n\n\n\n\nV\n\nINDUSTRIAL BONDS\n\n\nIndustrial bonds include the obligations of all manufacturing and\nmercantile\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": null, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_b5d8d1d3360c270e1873665e0df25dcb0e783b6ca2fc79edbc76636743325cb9_v2"}
