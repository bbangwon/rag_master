Economic factors such as inflation rates, employment levels, and consumer confidence can dictate how securities are valued and traded. When general conditions are favorable, securities tend to perform well, attracting more investors and increasing demand.

Investors often analyze economic indicators to gauge the potential for returns on their investments. For instance, during periods of economic growth, investors may be more inclined to invest in equities, anticipating higher returns.
