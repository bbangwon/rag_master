After several years of continued and increasing business\nprosperity the positions are just reversed.\n\nNo discussion of real-estate mortgages would be complete without\nallusion to the guaranteed mortgages which have been placed upon the\nmarket in great quantities within the past few years. Guaranteed\nmortgages are real-estate mortgages guaranteed as to principal and\ninterest by substantial companies having large capital and surplus. In\naddition to the guaranty, the companies usually search and guarantee the\ntitle, see to it that the taxes, assessments, and insurance are paid,\nand perform the other services of a real-estate broker. Their\ncompensation varies somewhat, but probably averages 1/2 per cent--that\nis, for example, they loan at 5 per cent and sell guaranteed mortgages\nto the investor at 4-1/2.\n\nThe value of the guaranty may be considered from two points of\nview--first, in the event of a general decline in real-estate values,\nand, secondly, when a fall occurs in a particular piece of property or\nin a particular locality.\n\nIf a severe decline in real-estate values takes place, affecting all\nlocalities, it might become necessary for the holders of guaranteed\nmortgages to test the value of their guaranties. In such a case the\nquestion would arise how far the capital and surplus of the guaranteeing\ncompanies would extend in liquidating the mortgages\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": null, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_ba957c233bb71a4e1c34ecd1a4799aac66566aaf41a2fae42010151189345dbc_v2"}
