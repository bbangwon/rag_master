To the\nextent to which this policy is followed, an equity is created back of\nthe bonds which raises their intrinsic value. This policy contrasts\nfavorably with the general practise of English roads to pay out all\ntheir earnings in dividends, and to capitalize their improvements. In\naddition, new capital for American railroads is largely raised by stock\nissues, which further increases the margin of security for the\nbondholders. Taken together these facts insure a steady enhancement in\nthe intrinsic value of railroad bonds, which is bound to be reflected,\nother things being equal, in higher prices.\n\nWe shall not attempt to discuss at this time the degree of stability of\nmarket price which railroad bonds enjoy. As explained in the first\nchapter, stability of market price is dependent upon general financial\nand business conditions. It is sufficient to point out here that the\nmaintenance intact of the principal sum invested can only be rendered\ncertain by the purchase of short-time securities whose near approach to\nmaturity will keep their price close to par. In a later chapter the\ngeneral principles which determine this question will be elucidated.\n\nThe ideal investment may be defined as one combining ample security of\nprincipal and interest, a good rate of income, ready convertibility into\ncash, and reasonable promise of appreciation in value.
